Puji (Remake)
===============

Description
---------------

Puji is a game [originally created](http://www.patkemp.com/wp-gallery/games/puji.html "Puji") by Alexander Jhin, Matt McKnett and Pat Kemp.
We decided to create a remake of it and develop it via GitHub. Stay tuned.

Behind the scenes
---------------

As we were travelling to Thessaloniki, Greece by train and we wanted to play Puji, we realized that there were four of us and Puji can be played by at most 3 players. So we decided to create a remake of the original game to have an occupation during the trip and to create a version with more than 3 players allowed. Although we didn't manage to finish the game before arriving, we are planning to continue developing this project in GitHub.

Technology
---------------

Our remake is based on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript as we wanted to practice our web developing skills and create something that can go online.
We have also used many files from [dionyziz'](https://github.com/dionyziz dionyziz on Github) repository, [Bubble Trouble](https://github.com/dionyziz/bubble-trouble bubble-trouble on GitHub), which is another HTML5 game we built with our then team leader of Greece in JBOI 2012.
